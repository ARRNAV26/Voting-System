# Real-Time Voting System for Internal Suggestions

A modern, real-time voting system built with Python FastAPI and React TypeScript for internal company suggestions. Features live vote updates, user authentication, and a beautiful responsive interface.

## Voting Rules and Permissions

### Who Can Vote?
In this voting system, **any authenticated user except the author of a suggestion** can cast a like (upvote) or dislike (downvote) vote for a suggestion.

#### **Detailed Explanation**

1. **Authentication Requirement**
   - Only users who are logged in (i.e., have a valid JWT token) can interact with the voting API.
   - Unauthenticated users cannot vote; the backend will return a 401 Unauthorized error.

2. **Author Restriction**
   - The backend explicitly prevents the author of a suggestion from voting on their own suggestion.
   - In `backend/app/api/votes.py`, before allowing a vote, the code checks:
     ```python
     if suggestion.author_id == current_user.id:
         raise HTTPException(
             status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
             detail="Cannot vote on your own suggestion"
         )
     ```
   - This means: **You cannot like or dislike your own suggestion.**
   - The frontend also disables the voting buttons for the author of the suggestion in `HomePage.tsx`:
     ```ts
     const canVote = user && user.id !== suggestion.author_id;
     ```
   - If you are the author, the like/dislike buttons are not clickable.
   - Even if the frontend is bypassed (e.g., by using Postman), the backend will reject any vote attempt by the author.

3. **One Vote Per User Per Suggestion**
   - Each user can only have one vote (like or dislike) per suggestion.
   - If a user votes again, it updates their previous vote (switches from like to dislike or vice versa).
   - If a user removes their vote, it deletes their vote record for that suggestion.

#### **Summary Table**

| User Type         | Can Like/Dislike? | Notes                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Not logged in     | No                | Must log in to vote                   |
| Suggestion author | No                | Cannot vote on own suggestion         |
| Other user        | Yes               | Can like/dislike once per suggestion  |

#### **Example Scenarios**
- **Alice** creates a suggestion. She cannot vote on it.
- **Bob** logs in and sees Alice‚Äôs suggestion. He can like or dislike it.
- **Bob** can change his vote from like to dislike, or remove it.
- **Charlie** (another user) can also vote, but not more than once per suggestion.

**In summary:**
> Only logged-in users who are NOT the author of a suggestion can cast a like or dislike vote for that suggestion. Each user can only vote once per suggestion, and the backend enforces all these rules for security and fairness.

## Technical Approach

This real-time voting system is built using a modern full-stack architecture with Python FastAPI as the backend API and React with TypeScript for the frontend. The system employs WebSocket connections for real-time updates, ensuring that vote counts and new suggestions are instantly reflected across all connected clients without requiring page refreshes.

### Backend Architecture (FastAPI)
- **FastAPI Framework**: Leverages FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI documentation, type validation, and high performance for building RESTful APIs
- **WebSocket Support**: Uses FastAPI's built-in WebSocket support for real-time bidirectional communication
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Implements a clean data layer with SQLAlchemy for database operations and Alembic for migrations
- **SQLite for Development**: Uses SQLite for easy development setup (PostgreSQL for production)
- **Pydantic Models**: Implements data validation and serialization using Pydantic models
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured CORS for secure cross-origin requests
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses FastAPI's dependency injection for clean service architecture

### Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)
- **React 18 with TypeScript**: Modern React with strict typing for better development experience
- **Vite Build Tool**: Fast development server and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **React Query**: For efficient server state management and caching
- **WebSocket Client**: Custom WebSocket hook for real-time updates
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI/UX patterns

### Real-Time Communication
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Bidirectional communication for instant updates
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Backend broadcasts events to all connected clients
- **Connection Management**: Proper WebSocket connection handling with reconnection logic
- **State Synchronization**: Frontend maintains local state that syncs with server state

### Security & Best Practices
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on both frontend and backend
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse with proper rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for better code quality
- **Environment Configuration**: Proper environment variable management
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment for easy scaling

### Assumptions Made
1. **Single Organization**: The system is designed for internal use within one organization
2. **Simple Authentication**: Basic session-based authentication (can be extended to OAuth/JWT)
3. **SQLite for Development**: Uses SQLite for easy development (PostgreSQL for production)
4. **Modern Browser Support**: Targets modern browsers with WebSocket support
5. **Development Environment**: Assumes Node.js and Python 3.8+ are available
6. **Network Requirements**: Assumes stable network connection for WebSocket functionality

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reload**: Both frontend and backend support hot reloading for rapid development
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI docs for easy API exploration
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database to frontend
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for backend services, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Deployment Ready**: Docker configuration for easy deployment and scaling

This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and a smooth developer experience while providing a robust real-time voting platform.
